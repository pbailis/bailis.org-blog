Introductory note: Given the high <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/the-last-frontier-for-computers-scent/">risk</a> of being <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcua/status/134837175580758017">scooped</a>, I've decided to unveil my vision for the future of human computer interaction and crowdsourced databases. &nbsp;In light of the impending explosion of research in this area, I have deviated from my plans to submit to a proper database conference and have instead chosen to publicly lay claim to these ideas in this post. &nbsp;Because you'll wonder, I am serious about these ideas and believe there are interesting problems in this space. &nbsp;I'd even entertain proposals for collaboration.<br /><br />(Edit: To be clear, I'm kidding about getting scooped. &nbsp;This isn't my day-to-day&nbsp;<a href="http://cs.berkeley.edu/~pbailis/research.html">research</a>, but I do like the idea.)<br /><br />Current crowdsourced databases are incapable of answering three major classes of queries. &nbsp;Database systems such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/papers/crowddb_sigmod2011.pdf">CrowdDB</a> and <a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/mturk.pdf">Qurk</a>&nbsp;leverage human-powered computation to answer queries that computers cannot typically answer, such as performing complex image classification or processing uncertain or underspecified queries. &nbsp;These systems are generic but have thus far focused on processing known&nbsp;<i>information</i>&nbsp;about entities in the outside world. &nbsp;However, to the best of my knowledge, crowdsourced databases have overlooked a large part of the human experience: our <i>senses</i>. &nbsp;In the remainder of this post, I will outline crowdsourcing extensions that represent an improvement over existing databases: the ability to query over scents, tastes, and tactile sensations.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_1028.htm#nose">Olfaction</a>, <a href="http://www.digikey.com/us/en/techzone/sensors/resources/articles/The-Five-Senses-of-SensorsTaste.html">taste</a>, and <a href="http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/retrographic_sensor.pdf">touch/texture </a>sensors are immature and are relatively specialized. Computers cannot reliably answer a wide range of pressing questions about raw sensory input and our interactions with the physical world. &nbsp;Electronic sensors can detect specialized inputs, such as chemical presence (e.g., <a href="http://www.aps.org/about/governance/task-force/counter-terrorism/coffey.cfm">explosives</a>) and some flavors (e.g., selected features of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400500003786">wine</a>) but, to the best of my knowledge, are not generally applicable or widely available.<br /><br />Online databases can answer questions about particular sensing domains such as <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/">beer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.dishola.com/">food</a>&nbsp;tasting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_Radio">musical preferences</a>. &nbsp;These databases contain knowledge of high-level, narrowly-constrained semantic interpretations of the raw sensory data. &nbsp;A beer rating is a condensation of multiple factors, many of which are reflections on the beer's taste, nose, and mouthfeel--but the raw taste, scent, and mouthfeel data is not available.<br /><br />Operating on raw data allows greater query expressivity and insight than operating on&nbsp;<a href="http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/08/17/inside-pandora-web-radio.html">a set of features describing the data</a>. We can view preferences regarding senses as functions over the set of raw stimuli in the world. &nbsp;Without sensory data, it is difficult to infer connections between sensations, such as why we like taste of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter,_banana_and_bacon_sandwich">peanut butter, banana, and bacon in sandwiches</a>, the smell of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_%26_Plenty">cucumber and Good &amp; Plentys</a>, and the seemingly culturally universal combination of heat and steam in a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna">sweat lodge</a>. &nbsp;We cannot easily make connections between even somewhat similar domains. &nbsp;For example, answering questions about wine and recipe pairings requires either additional cross-domain knowledge (a database of explicit beer and recipe pairings)&nbsp;<i>or</i>&nbsp;lower-level sensory data (what flavors are in each beer?) paired with filters on this data. &nbsp;These solutions appear similar, however the latter scales to more domains without requiring additional external expert input.<br /><br />While computers are deficient at answering sense-based queries, thankfully (and by definition), most humans come complete with detectors for all five of our senses. &nbsp;Employing humans to power&nbsp;<i>general-purpose</i> sensory databases is a natural extension of crowdsourcing technology. &nbsp;Compared to a specialized mechanical solution such as a chemical-specific detector, a human crowd is more general and likely less expensive than highly-specialized equipment when answering a wide range of queries. &nbsp;Similarly, humans can be used for both lower-level sensory analysis and broader semantic-level comparisons than narrowly scoped online information aggregation sites. &nbsp;Accordingly, I propose the development of a crowdsourced sense-oriented database,&nbsp;<b>SenseDB</b>. &nbsp;This database no doubt needs a query language for user-defined functions, which will consist of embedded DSLs for scent, taste, and touch queries, or&nbsp;<b>NoseSQL</b>,&nbsp;<b>FlavorSQL</b>, and&nbsp;<b>FeelSQL</b>, respectively.<br /><br />Harnessing the power of human-powered sense-based query processing leads to several research questions:<br /><br /><b>Raw versus semantically-rich data.</b>&nbsp;To what extent does encoding raw sensory data aid in query processing? &nbsp;Does querying a (logical) database of taste, scent, and touch details provide higher accuracy, speed, or throughput than simply presenting the question to a crowd from a high semantic perspective? &nbsp;Can we better re-use raw data between queries? Do semantically rich queries impact the bias of the results?<br /><br /><b>Encoding</b>.&nbsp;How do we encode the sensory details required to answer a query? Which aspects of the sensory experience are required to answer a query?&nbsp;The degree of specificity in formulating a particular query limits the applicability of the results for future queries and analysis.&nbsp;There are <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_ics_browse.htm?ICS1=67&amp;ICS2=240">many published ISO standards</a> governing sensory analysis (including which <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=67&amp;ics2=240&amp;ics3=&amp;csnumber=38031">tasting glasses</a> to use with olive oil), but applying these standards to a general-purpose crowdsourced query processing system remains an open problem.<br /><div><br /><b>Transmission.&nbsp;</b>Sights and sounds can be easily recorded and transmitted for processing, but we lack mechanisms for reliably communicating touch, taste, and smell stimuli. &nbsp;One option is to use a crowd that is physically co-located with the set of objects to be queried, but this does not scale in the size of the set of objects or in the number of queries.</div><div><br /><b>Non-human processing.</b>&nbsp;Are humans the most efficient computation engine for sensory queries? &nbsp;Can we humanely use canines or other macrobiotic organisms to process these queries instead? &nbsp;How does the throughput of a non-human compute engine compare to a human compute engine? &nbsp;What about queries per second, queries per dollar, or total cost of ownership? Both <a href="http://www.deanfriedman.com/zine-state/zine_stateoftheuniverse-02.html">rats</a> and <a href="http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/7.3/focus/townsend2/townsend2.htm">pigs</a> have been successfully employed in demining scenarios, however the generality of these mechanisms is unclear.</div><div><br />These challenges are only a subset of the problems inherent in developing a sense-oriented query database. &nbsp;However, given the apparent advantages of ScentDB, I believe the database community will rise to the occasion and take crowdsourcing to the next level, providing valuable insights into the human condition along the way.<br /><br /><i>I would like to thank Joe Hellerstein, Mike Franklin, the BOOM team, and those explicitly not mentioned here for their feedback on these ideas.</i></div>
