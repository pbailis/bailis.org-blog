This is a growing list of other people's advice that I've found
useful, posted here mostly for my own reference. (As if there
weren't enough of these already.)

On Writing
----------

* [The Elements of Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by Strunk and White<br>
*tl;dr:* A classic on good prose and English writing.

* [Pet Peeves for Writing](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/writing.html) by Margo Seltzer<br>
*tl;dr:* Read it. It's short. Don't do these things.

* [LaTeX Usage Notes](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~kohler/latex.html) by Eddie Kohler<br>
*tl;dr:* A (beautifully typeset) document on proper LaTeX formatting, typography, and writing tips.


On Speaking
----------

* [Slide Design for Developers](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) by Zach Holman<br>
*tl;dr:* Practical tips for making your slides better: color, huge fonts, slides as prop, not as a crutch.

* [The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html) by Edward Tufte<br>
*tl;dr:* Tufte provides many examples of how not to make slides, and his perspective on the "projector operating system" is valuable.

On Research
-----------

* [You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) by Edward Hamming<br>
*tl;dr:* How to ask the right questions and scope your research for maximum impact by a guy who did both.
* [Cargo Cult Science](http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm) by Richard Feynman<br>
*tl;dr:* Don't let PR, hype, or zeitgeist interfere with real science.
* [How to Have a Bad Career in Research/Academia](http://cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/BadCareer.pdf) by Dave Patterson<br>
*tl;dr:* Good advice on pitfalls of graduate school/academia and how to avoid them.
* [Software is not science](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2011/11/software-is-not-science.html) by Matt Welsh<br>
*tl;dr:* Systems research is about principles, not artifacts.
* [Database Metatheory: Asking the Big Queries](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.135.1614&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
by Christos Papadimitriou<br>
*tl;dr:* An awesome reflection on theory versus practice by one of the great CS theoreticians.
